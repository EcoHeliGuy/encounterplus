FAQ Web Client for Encounter Plus

# How does the Web Client work?
The device that is running the game can act as a server for other players to connect to either locally or over the internet. Just go into the external display setting located in the top left of E+ and turn it on.

### Why doesnâ€™t the URL E+ gives me work?
**There are two parts to this question.**
1. Part one: you need to **open port 8080 on your router** for the IP address E+ is displaying. That needs to be done on your router. **Please refer to your routers user manual** or https://portforward.com for information on how to change port settings.
2. Part two: **There are two URLs** that Encounter Plus gives your for remote play. One is for local play and one is for remtoe play. **To play remotely requires the "Public Access" URL.** Tapping on the "Public Access" button will show you the URL and it will look like this: http://client.encounter.plus?remoteHost=[your IP Address Here]:8080. This will be the URL to give to you players to remote into your server. 

*Note: IPv6 support has been recently added. So if your ISP provides this type of IP address, make sure you havce updated to the latest version of Encounter Plus.

### I opened the port and got my IP address, but it still says Websocket Disconnected when players try to join.
This can happen when **browsers automatically redirect to https://client.encounter.plus instead of http://client.encounter.plus.** Try turning on **incognito mode in Chrome or Private Browsing in Safari** to keep it from redirecting. If your browser is still redirecting to https, **try clearing your browser history.** 

**Note: Currently, only Safari and Chrome have been tested for the E+ Web Client.** 

### All or some of my tokens aren't appearing on the web client.
**Try moving the tokens around to refresh them** on the web client side. Also **try re-placing the tokens**, this can be done by dragging them in from the initiative list or double tapping on the map and pressing `place create`/`place party`. If that doens't work, **try turning off web server in E+ and turning it back on.** Once this is done **have the players reconnect.** 

### What are the different settings in the web server section of E+?
Those allow the DM to control how many people can interact with the tokens onscreen at any given point. When it is set to **All**, then anyone can move tokens at anytime. Setting it to **Turn Only** will only allow tokens to move on their turn. Setting it to **None** will only allow the DM to move tokens. 

### Known Issues

There is no way to kick players from the server.
